/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <h1>Welcome to Li†eBlog</h1>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/chyt/lite/tree/master/liteblog">https://github.com/chyt/lite/tree/master/liteblog</a></p>
    <p>Li†eBlog is designed to be an alternative type of blogging tool. While other blogging services such as Wordpress or Blogger center your website around your blog, we understand that in some cases you may have already have a website designed, and are seeking to implement a blog page into a site that already is fully functional. </p>
    <p>In this case, it doesn't make sense to completely reshape your website around a blogging framework. This is where Li†eBlog comes in. Rather than try to design your entire website for you, Li†eBlog acts as an unobtrusive blog &quot;plugin&quot; that you can quickly and easily customize to fit the theme of your site. </p>
    <p>Li†eBlog is designed to be a very lightweight and simple blogging &quot;plugin&quot; which contours easily to your existing website. Managing your blog is all done on one page, where you can add new posts, edit/delete existing posts, and customize the appearance of the blog. Then, with one line of PHP code, you can embed your entire Li†eBlog blog onto just about any webpage.</p>
<h2>Embedding Li†eBlog</h2>
    <p>Just type in the following PHP code wherever you would like Li†eBlog to be embedded:</p>
    <p>&lt;? include ('http://sample.com/link/to/liteblog.php'); ?&gt;</p>
    <p>Below is an example of Li†eBlog embedded on this web page using the code above. You will have to first set up Li†eBlog using the steps detailed in <a href="readme.txt" target="_blank">readme.txt</a> before the example will display properly.</p>
    <div>
    <? include ('liteblog.php'); ?>
    </div>
<p>Below the Li†eBlog embed, you can continue to put any content that you wish. More content here. View <a target="_blank" href="liteblog.php">liteblog.php</a> to see what Li†eBlog looks like by itself.</p>
<p>Now we are ending this page, with Li†eBlog successfully embedded.<!-- end .content --></p>
