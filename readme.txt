WELCOME TO THE Li†e PROJECT

https://github.com/chyt/lite

The Li†e Project is managed by Charles Tian (http://github.com/chyt), an independent web designer and programmer. The project began with the goal of providing web developers with simple plugins that can be quickly and easily embedded into an existing functional website. Do not download any Li†e plugins from any source other than https://github.com/chyt/lite/. The link above is the only official page where the Li†e project is updated.

Li†eBlog is designed to be an alternative type of blogging tool. While other blogging services such as Wordpress or Blogger center your website around your blog, we understand that in some cases you may have already have a website designed, and are seeking to implement a blog page into a site that already is fully functional. 

In this case, it doesn't make sense to completely reshape your website around a blogging framework. This is where Li†eBlog comes in. Rather than try to design your entire website for you, Li†eBlog acts as an unobtrusive blog "plugin" that you can quickly and easily customize to fit the theme of your site. 

Li†eBlog is designed to be a very lightweight and simple blogging "plugin" which contours easily to your existing website. Managing your blog is all done on one page, where you can add new posts, edit/delete existing posts, and customize the appearance of the blog. Then, with one line of PHP code, you can embed your entire Li†eBlog blog onto just about any webpage.
